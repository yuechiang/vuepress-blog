# How To “Select All” In Vim/Vi?

## Use ggVG To Select All

All content of a file can be selected by using the Visual Mode of Vim or Vi. First, we will press the ESC key to change normal mode. Then we will move to the start of the file by using the gg keys. Then enable the visual mode with the V key and the last step is pressing G which will select from the start of the file to the end of the file. In short, you can use the following key sequences to select all content.

## Select and Copy All Lines

The %y command can be used to select and copy all lines with a single command.

```
:%y
```
